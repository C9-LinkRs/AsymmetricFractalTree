# AsymmetricFractalTree
An algorithm to draw an asymmetric fractal tree.
I used the same code that Symmetric-FractalTree and i did some modification to adapted it to an asymmetric fractal tree, the modification consist in add 2 new variables, rightAngleVar and leftAngleVar (I deleted angle variable), with this variables i can control de angle of the branches of the tree, if you play with them you can do a symmetric fractal tree.
